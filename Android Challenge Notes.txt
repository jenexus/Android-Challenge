Instructions to build

1. Clone the repository

Architectural Decision

1. I decided to use koin since it is lightweight. Making it suitable for smaller application like this android challenge.
2. Additionally, I employ MVVM for the structure to separate the logic from the view.


Improvements

1. Implementation of fetching data from the API.
2. Use of the latest technologies like android compose to build the UI
